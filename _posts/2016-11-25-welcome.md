Welcome!
<br><br>
Well, you found it. This is my site. I'll post pretty much anything I feel like hosting in this tiny corner of the web here. Hosted by github pages and powered by jekyll. Check em out. Site is written mostly in HTML5 and CSS with some Javascript. Hope to host some stuff that requires a backend using a Swift server on my Rasberry Pi soon... We'll see. üëç. Hope you like it!
